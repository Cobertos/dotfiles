# Dot Files

A collection of configs and dot files for programs I use on Windows.

* **Public** - There are no private keys or licenses in here (they should be created separately)
* **Console** - Most everything should be geared towards my console environment. Large GUI stuff/versioning should be in Dropbox

* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
