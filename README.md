# Dot Files

A collection of configs and dot files for programs I use on Windows.

* **Public** - There are no private keys or licenses in here (they should be created separately)
* **Console** - Most everything should be geared towards my console environment. Large GUI stuff/versioning should be in Dropbox
* **Portable** - Should be possible to use in multiple environments (at work, at home). Requires different configs sometimes...
* **Linking** - Configs should use symbolic links as much as possible, copying requires more maintenance.
* **Automatic** - Create a script that outlines installation, for remembering what everything means and to speed up computer setup in the future

# Requires Python 3.6+ (interpolated literals and other fun things)

# Will add configurations for

* [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
* [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/en/Downloads.html)
* WSL

* Paint.NET
* Blender

# Tools that just need installation
(maybe move to Chocolatey?)
(TODO: Move to chocolatey when packages.config export is a thing, otherwise it's kind of useless for my workflow)
* 7zip
* Dropbox
* Lastpass
* Chrome
* Firefox
* Discord
* Standard Notes
* Git for Windows
* VLC Media Player
* Ino Reader
* FooBar 3000
* OpenHardwareMonitor
* OBS
* Unity
* ShareX

# To Add

* Python 3 (and associated linters)
* NodeJS (and associated linters) (probably better to install nvm)
* Paint.NET
* Any other useful programs or scripts
